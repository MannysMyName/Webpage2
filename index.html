<h1>Emmanuel is my name, drawing's my game</h1>
<div id="spaghetti">I’m a cartoonist, graphic artist, and occasional animator based in the Chicago area.
I have two webcomics under my belt, and I plan on starting at least one more.
My art has already been acknowledged in quite a few circles.
My inspirations range from Raina Telgemeier, to Dan DeCarlo.
Feel free to contact me at mannyasiegbu@ymail.com or follow me on social
media if you wish to see more of my work. It’s always a treat!.</div>
